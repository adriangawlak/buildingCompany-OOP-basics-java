# buildingCompany-OOP-basics-java

This is my first serious project in Java. 

The project was written to learn basics of Object oriented programming.  
It utilizes concepts like: Collections, polymorphism, inheritance and exceptions.
Main class is prepopulated with sample objects to show how the program functions.

This project is written in Polish and can be run in IDE.
